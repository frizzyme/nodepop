ecommerce API


The practice consists in developing the API that will run on the server of a service for selling second-hand items called Nodepop.

The service maintains ads for buying or selling items and allows you to search as put
filters by various criteria, so the API to be developed provides the necessary methods for that. 
Each ad has the following data:
● Item name, an ad will always have only one item.
● Whether the item is for sold. 
● Price. It will be the price of the item in case it is a sale offer. 
● Photo of the item. Each ad will have only one photo.
● Ad Tags. It may contain one or several of these four: work, lifestyle, motor
and mobile

Operations to be performed by the API to be created:
- List of ads with possibility of pagination. With filters by tag, type of ad
(sale or search), and article name (starting with the
(starting with the searched data).
- List of existing tags

The systems where the API will be deployed use MongoDB databases.
